ADC ( Alarm Distancing Covid)

Problem : Sometimes people when waiting in line forget the distance between people around them and also people do not care about those who stand close to him

Why this is important is resolved? : To not be contagious and prevent the chain of spread of the covid-19 virus, we must therefore remain social distancing

Solution : We created an alarm to keep a distance between people with people around him
